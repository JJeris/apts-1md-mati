TODO:
Plan:
- Open and read file DONE, need to actually read hair.in correctly and
    - Make a linked list with the number of barbers as the first line of the file
    - Needs to make a new linked list with the customers, storing: time, when they arrived, their number and the amount of time, that it would take, for them to have their haircut.
- Make a linked list of the barbers DONE, need to be able to make another linked list, where we store the busy barbers, where
    - We store the number of the barber, the customer the barber is currently working with, all the time variables and so on. NOTE: The free barbers will be stored in the original linked-list, with only their number as the value, for now - might need to add how many customers he has worked, time worked, last customer and so on.
